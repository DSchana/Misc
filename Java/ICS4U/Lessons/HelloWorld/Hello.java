/*
public - In Java classes and methods are either public or private. Private restricts access

class Hello - The class name ("Hello") must match the filename ("Hello.java")
			- Java is object oriented. Everything is either a class or an object

class - An abstract template that describes objects
object - An instance of the class (a variable)
*/

/*
Every program must have a main method.
This is called the "entry point" of the program
The program starts execution in the main method

public static void main(String[] args) {}

static - Belongs to the class as opposed to belongs to an object
void - In Java, all methods need a return type, and you must return that type. Void returns nothing.
